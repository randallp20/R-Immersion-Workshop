## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Data Frames

are lists of vectors

```{r}
x(2,3)
x$m[2]
x[[3]][2]

```


## example of creating data frame
```{r example of creating data frame}
d <- data.frame(list(gene=c("BRCA1","PTEN"),chr=c("chr17","chr10"), begin=c(43044296,87863113)))
d
d$gene
write.table(d,file="cancer_genes.txt",sep="\t",quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=TRUE)
e<-read.table(file="cancer_genes.txt",header=TRUE,sep="\t")

```
